## A Quick Primer on Burnout

There are two types of people in this world - people who have experienced burnout, and people who haven't. If you've never experienced it before - I hope this serves you well in preventing it in your life. If you have experienced burnout, well...you may not even know you have. I didn't actually realize what had happened to me until months after my stress, much like the fourth movement of a Classical era symphony knocks an audience off their feet, had crescendoed into a disastrous climax of burnout.

## Let's Talk About Stress

Stress. It's a wonderful response mechanism that our bodies use to respond to what life throws at us. We all generally consider stress a negative thing, but short term stresses can be considered healthy. Did you know that physiologically speaking, exercise is considered a stressor on your body? You get your heart rate up, exert your muscles, and after some time of rest, your body recovers stronger than it was before. It's how humans adapt.

However, if you expose your body to long term stress, it has disastrous effects. Stress can only be positive if you give your body the space to recover and heal. This is where burnout comes into play - my totally unscientific definition of burnout is - submitting your body to an onslaught of continuous stress, robbing it of the chance to recover, which will slowly break your mind and body down to the point of failure.

## A Battle of Attrition - The Path Towards Burnout

Our lives fluctuate between good and bad times. Stressful and peaceful times.

A path towards burnout is one that does not follow this pattern. It's a lifestyle of repeated stressors with no "downtime". An all-too-common example of how this manifests in practice is someone who identifies as a "workaholic" - Someone like this generally works as much as they can, and considers it upside that they have the wherewithal to be able to withstand working ad libitum. Workaholics define their _entire_ self worth with their professional accolades. Hell, I was literally this person up until a year ago.

## Breaking Point

A major problem with the "workaholic" mindset is that a workaholic will try to pull themselves out of a hole by working _harder_, instead of pulling back and giving their brain a chance to breathe. Think about it - someone like this who has reached success has done so by their self-defined work ethic.

> The candle burns brightest just before it goes out.

How many of us have heard this proverb before? Well, it holds true with burnout. As the stressors of life build up, one prone to burnout will begin to exert themselves _even more_ in response. The stress compounds.

Previous to my time at Zapier, I was promoted into a leadership position at a Gainesville tech startup, and my former job with clear responsibilities evolved into a job of limitless responsibilities. Limitless work. Unbounded stress.

In the beginning, you may notice some undesirable symptoms. Maybe you're irritable to your partner after work. Maybe your diet breaks down and you find yourself eating way too many sweets. Maybe your once perfect exercise habits deteriorate and you start to make excuses for not going to the gym.

These things start to add additional stressors to your life. Since you haven't recovered from the original stressor, they only serve to compound the issue. They're just band-aids. Slowly, more unsettling symptoms start to creep in - You begin to lose interest in your most pleasurable hobbies like playing guitar. Maybe that beer you enjoyed to unwind after work turned into a whole six pack. Perhaps Fall settles in and you bust out your favorite pair of jeans only to realize they don't fit anymore.

## Downward Spiral

Once you hit your breaking point and your metaphorical candle flickers out,

## Closing Thoughts

Maybe you are the type of person who has great boundaries with work, and other stressors. Maybe you give yourself time to relax on the weekend. Maybe you even have the ability to disengage with social media at times like this when your country's political landscape can predispose you to [doomsday scrolling](https://www.wired.com/story/stop-doomscrolling/) on social media for hours on end.

If you struggle with this balancing act, and perhaps even think you're on a negative downward slope in this regard, you may be on your way to some form of burnout and not even know it. I wanted to write this article to share my own lived experiences with burnout in hopes that I can prevent someone else from suffering the same fate.

I want to share a few things that may help you out in identifying this and fixing it:

- Talk to your loved ones and open up. This is not an easy thing, but at least in my experience I created barriers with my family rather than leaned on them when I needed them. I made the connection in my mind that I had to not only constantly work, but I had to put up a "tough guy" attitude and persevere. That only made it harder on me to eventually come to terms with the situation I created for myself.
- Seek out therapy. Therapy is not a weakness, it's a huge benefit that people often dismiss because of social stigma. Let me repeat this one for the people in the back _SEEK OUT THERAPY. THERAPY IS HEALING_. Remember earlier how we connected a healthy lifestyle balance containing both stressors and healing? When you have traumatic experiences, therapy is a tool that is proven to help you recover.
