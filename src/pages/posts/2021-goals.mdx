## An overview of my 2020

As we enter this new year, I want to take some time to reflect on the last year of my personal and professional growth.

### Professional achievements

- Rebuilt from the ground up most core Zapier interior pages like My Apps, My Zaps, Settings and Task History
- Wrote some brand new zapier.com experiences such as Zap Details and Task Usage
- Spearheaded a huge technical shift at Zapier in migrating our codebase to TypeScript, and creating buyin at the company so future work is written in TypeScript.
- Untangled our giant ball of yarn of monorepo frontend code to begin splitting our code out into a new focused repo that my team owns entirely.

### Personal achievements

- I stayed safe by not contracting COVID19 🦠
- I bought a house! 🏡
- I started to climb out of the "burnout hole" I dug myself into 😓
- I started going to physical therapy to treat a chronic back injury that I sustained in 2016, decimating a lot of athletic progress I made from 2011-2015 🏋🏻‍♀️
